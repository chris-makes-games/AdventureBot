button stuff
  the ConfirmButton in database is all set up to have different confirmations sent to it but just has placeholders at the moment and needs actual functions for things happening on confirm

adventure stuff
  creation mode for new rooms to be added (WIP)
  room tree to show room connections (WIP)

command stuff
  all commands reworked to files (WIP)
  double check that commands from players only work in threads (new player has multiple possible channels. Things might break if commands can be ran outside of the correct channels)

misc:
  functions for pulling documents and updating all classes (done for rooms)
  change bot buttons to always be clickable (no downtime issues)

  Update and make roomid, itemid, nameid into the bot code in appropriate places.in the class's, the main.py, database.py (i think this is done - sarnt)

  formatter has a lot of outdated stuff, and a lot of commands need to be added/updated/removed. Need to double check each help command and need to add help for admin help
