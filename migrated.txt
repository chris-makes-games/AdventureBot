  register
  new adventure(command, now checks to see if the player has a edit adventure already, , then it checks that the player is in the example adventure,   if both do not exist it then makes a new adventure in testadventures and makes a thread then it looks for the thread id for the edit adventure and logs the information on the players user database )

  register_channel
  create blank adventure ( turns into a object and inserts one)

  changes made post valentines:
  - I saw a few new classes created in main.py, they seemed to be trying to create confirmation buttons when a player tries different commands but they were not formatted correctly. There is also already a confirm button class (database.ConfirmButton) which performs the desired functionality. I deleted the button classes in main and did some cleanup around them to make the code executable.
(in general, no classes should be getting defined at the bottom of main. For organization purposes, classes should have their own file and then import to main. I have a few custom classes in database but they need to be in database to access other functions.)
  - Removed kill command and confirm kill button (not really relevant to current design goals, need to create a command to leave an adventure without deleting player data)
  - There was a second /join method under construction, also with errors. The new intended functionality of /join isnt to create a new player but to join a new adventure. Deleted the duplicate /join and updated the old one to be a slash command. Moved the autocomplete for join up to be next to the method. Edited the old join command so that it works as intended, still needs testing.
  - Updated the deleteitem slash command. It was previously trying to use the broken ConfirmDeleteItem class, which was deleted. Instead, it now uses the database.confirm_embed class and sends the item data there to be deleted upon confirmation.
  - Updated deleteroom slash command same as deleteitem, and fixed the autocomplete function for it. Still needs some testing, I dunno if the AI did the regex correctly.
  - Removed the /info command. It doesn't really serve a purpose anymore. Kept it in old_code.txt just in case.
  - Added /newplayer command. This does what old !join does. Someone can use this to add their own player info to the database, needs testing!
  - Added /deleteplayer command, needs testing!
  - Added a few parameters to the player class:
      - channel is now channels, a list of channels
      - admin boolean to discern who has privelages
